## Team BDNJ
David Fink is a finance major in his junior year here at Bucknell. He is really looking forward to applying skills he learns during this project to finance in the future.

Brad Schultes is a computer science engineering and management major in his sophomore year. He is looking forward to working on a lot of the backend development on this project

Nick Johnston is a computer science major in his sophomore year. He is excited to work on integrating the gui to this project.

## Project Information
We created a program that allows a user and a friend to play a poker game on the computer with a visual output of the cards being used in Scenebuilder. In our game the player is able to check their cards and then hide them so that the other player may do the same. Then the players can choose to see the flop, then the turn, and finally the river where the final card is flipped and the winner is displayed.
## Package Structure: 
Above is our java package that contains all of our coding files used in the making of our game. As can be seen, within our java package we have a main package holding all of the functionality classes for the program, a resources package which holds all of the card images and the guidelines for scene builder to display the game for the user, and then our test package which was used to test our methods within the main package. All of these packages are intertwined to allow the program to produce its output. Each package breaks down different pieces of the program in order to group together similar functions of the program and make the program a lot easier to follow. 
## 3rd Party Libraries:
JavaFX
